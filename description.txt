Competitive Coding Platform Development: Spearheaded the creation of a dynamic platform akin to LeetCode and Codeforces, 
where users engage in coding contests to test and enhance their skills, while receiving ratings based on their performance.

Comprehensive Practice Environment: Implemented a robust practice module allowing users to tackle questions from past contests,
 fostering skill refinement and mastery. Admins can seamlessly manage unpublished questions and upload test cases to enrich the practice experience.

Resource and Priority Management: Designed and implemented a sophisticated queue system to manage server resources efficiently,
 ensuring fair execution of contest submissions and prioritizing live contest activities over practice submissions.

Admin Tools for Contest Management: Developed admin functionalities enabling scheduling of upcoming contests,
 selection of unpublished questions, and post-contest rating and ranking management. Admins also have the ability to edit
, add, or remove unpublished problems, ensuring flexibility and control over contest content.
